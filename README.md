# Kata - match up game

**Original katas:**
+ [**#71 taken from IT Academy Full Stack Bootcamp - 15/01/26**](https://github.com/CloudSalander/kata-match-up)
+ [**#72 taken from IT Academy Full Stack Bootcamp - 22/01/26**](https://github.com/CloudSalander/kata-match-up-2)

The idea of this kata is to create the match up game. 

In the previous kata #71 I had to create a 4x4 cards table using HTML/CSS and a points counter (which no use at the moment).\
You can view the result in the image below, in this same Readme file.

## To do

Following that kata, now is the time to add some animation to the game:
+ Each card must now be interactive. Clicking on them will flip the visible side of the card and show the front side. To do this, I must use JavaScript.
+ All cards will have the same front side for now.
+ And as bonus track, a timer will be added. It will start with the first click.

## The game

The game looks like this so far:
