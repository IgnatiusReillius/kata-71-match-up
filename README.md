# Kata - match up game

[**Original kata 71 taken from IT Academy Full Stack Bootcamp - 15/01/26**](https://github.com/CloudSalander/kata-match-up)

The idea of this kata is to create the match up game. 

To start, I have to:

- Use HTML/CSS
- The table must have 4 cards by row and 4 columns
- This time I only have to create the 4 x 4 cards table, and a points counter that will only show 0 points for now
